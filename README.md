# ShadowKey: Advanced Upload Vulnerability Scanner

*ShadowKey is stronk cybersecurity tool designed to identify, exploit, and report upload vulnerabilities in web applications. By simulating a range of attack vectors and assessing file upload functionalities, ShadowKey aims to fortify your digital defenses, providing a comprehensive overview of potential security risks.*

## Core Features

**Basic Upload Vulnerability Assessment:** Leverages advanced scanning techniques to identify how an application handles various file uploads, pinpointing weaknesses in input sanitization and file type restriction mechanisms.

**Exploit Discovery and Execution:** Engages detected vulnerabilities with tailored exploits, testing the application's resilience against unauthorized file uploads and executing code to demonstrate impact.

**Automated Reconnaissance:** Employs a robust scanning engine to automatically detect all upload points within a target application, including hidden forms and endpoints, ensuring no path is left unchecked.

**Custom Payload Deployment:** Offers the flexibility to deploy custom payloads, enabling targeted testing against specific vulnerabilities or system configurations.

**In-Depth Reporting:** Generates detailed reports outlining discovered vulnerabilities, executed exploits, and recommended mitigation strategies, facilitating informed decision-making and prioritized remediation efforts.

- Upload Vulnerability Scanner: This module contains all functionalities related to scanning and assessing upload points and vulnerabilities. It's crucial for initial reconnaissance and understanding the scope of potential vulnerabilities.

- Exploit Tools: Separate module for actively exploiting vulnerabilities. Keeping exploit tools separate helps organize your tool's offensive capabilities distinctly from scanning and reporting functionalities.

- Report Generator: Dedicated to generating comprehensive reports based on the findings from scans and exploits. This modularity allows for flexible report generation that can be tailored as per user needs.

- Utils: Common utilities module to avoid code duplication and provide shared functionalities across the tool.
